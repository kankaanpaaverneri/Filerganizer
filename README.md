# Filerganizer
## Cross platform file organizing software.

Program allows user to create directories with specific rules.
For example organize files by filetype and date. Then all the files that go into that directory follows those rules.
You can add renaming rules for specified directory for example that file starts with created date and is followed by the directory name.
